# Movie_Recommendation
Developed a vector-based movie recommendation system using Python and the TMDB 5000 Movies Kaggle dataset. Implemented functionality to suggest similar movies based on attributes such as cast, genre, and title. Deployed the system using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
